<p>This is going to be great. Because tis all about me I suppose. Haha.</p>

<p>So, a little bit about me. I love to cook. Unfortunately all of my time is consumed with school, work, children, and binge watching Netflix. The latter is a guilty pleasure.</p>
<p>What I must say about learning HTML is that I'm not very good at it. Perhaps that is the point of needing guide through every step of the way. But, I must admit that it is very very interesting. I'm kind of digging it when I grasp a new section of it!</p>
<p>Hopefully the rest of the webpage making and HTML usage will get me far in my class. <a href> Graduation </a> in May is depending on it.</p>
